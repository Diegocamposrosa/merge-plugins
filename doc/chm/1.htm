<h1>Introduction<a name=m02></a></h1>

<h2>What is merge plugins?<a name=m03></a></h2>

<P>Merge Plugins is a Windows application coded in Delphi
(object-oriented Pascal).  Merge Plugins automates the process of
combining multiple Bethesda Plugin/Master Files (<B>.esp</B> and
<B>.esm</B>) into a single file.  The program interfaces with plugins
through the xEdit framework, and supports plugin files from Skyrim,
Oblivion, Fallout: New Vegas, and Fallout 3.</P>

<P>Merge Plugins doesn't just combine the contents of plugin files,
it also handles asset files associated with those plugin files,
automatically copying, renaming, and rebuilding assets as necessary
to create a mod that functions as the original mods did prior to
merging.  It also provides a dictionary file built from reports
submitted by users as a guide to the tool's effectiveness at merging
various plugin files.  Overall, Merge Plugins provides a powerful
interface by which merges can be created, tracked, and rebuilt.</P>

<H2>New Features<a name=m10></a></H2>
<P>Merge Plugins Standalone provides a large number of new features

			<P class="TableText">Script fragment handling</P>
		</TD>
		<TD WIDTH=457>
			<P class="TableText">Script fragments are small scripts that are 
      created by the game to assist with Quests, Scenes, and Dialog Topics.  
      These script fragments have FormID specific filenames, and thus need 
      to be renamed and recompiled when the FormID of the record they're 
      associated with changes.  Merge Plugins Standalone does this if you 
      set up the Papyrus Compiler and Champollion Decompiler integrations.</P>

		<TD WIDTH=190>
			<P class="TableText">INI file handling</P>
		</TD>
		<TD WIDTH=457>
			<P class="TableText">Some ESP files have INI files associated with 
      them.  These INI files are loaded by the game based on their filename.  
      In Merge Plugins Standalone, INI files are renamed and combined so 
      their functionality is retained after merging.</P>

			<P class="TableText">Speed increase</P>
		</TD>
		<TD WIDTH=457>

      text files that were then read by a separate Java application which 
      sent them to a server to be combined into a dictionary file.  With

      Plugins Standalone, its errors will be saved, and then reloaded 
      the next time you use the program.  These saved errors are linked 
      to the CRC32 hash of the plugin, so when the plugin is updated
