# Description
Merge Plugins is a standalone application for merging bethesda plugin files.  This application is still under development and should be considered pre-alpha.  I am not responsible for any damages this application may cause and cannot provide any guarantees on the usefulness or functionality it provides.  This application is purely experimental and is still under active development.

# Compiling
This project can be compiled with RAD Studio Delphi XE, or newer.  You can download a compiled build from the link below:

[Merge Plugins v2.0.0.314](http://puu.sh/iW4tm.zip)

# Usage
The exectutable will automatically detect load orders for Skyrim, Oblivion, Fallout New Vegas, and Fallout 3.  This exectuable should be run through Mod Organizer if you want it to use mods installed with Mod Organizer.  There are multiple integration features for working with Mod Organizer, so it is the recommended load order tool for use with this utility.

# Credits
Merge Plugins uses the xEdit API, which was designed by zilav, hlp, Sharlikran and ElminsterAU.  Merge Plugins also uses the superobject library for handling json cleanly and efficiently.
